# Jahassian Userstyles

Various userstyles created for NationStates by the incredible developers of [**Jahass**](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=jahass).

## **NationStates Dark Mode Improved**
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jahass/userstyles/main/nationstates-dark-mode-improved.user.css"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square" alt="Install Directly with Stylus"/></a>

### Prerequisites

1. NationStates is using the "Dark" theme in [**Settings**](https://www.nationstates.net/page=settings).
2. The browser extension [**Stylus**](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) is installed.
3. The font family [**Roboto**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) has been downloaded and installed.

### Changes

This style makes a number of changes that I consider Accessibility improvements:
* Serifed fonts are largely replaced with sans-serif fonts (Roboto)
* Font sizes are strategically increased
* Text contrast is improved
* Text padding is optimized
* Labels are added to some icons

Additionally, changes have been made to the style of the trading cards:
* Cards are smaller
* Various card elements are removed or modified to de-emphasize clutter
